// typeof => to find type of an variables
// console.log(typeof null) => object => This is actually a bug in JavaScript
// JavaScript values are represented internally as "type tags".
// null was given a type tag of 0 (same as for objects).
// So when typeof was implemented, it returned "object" for anything with tag 0.
// console.log(typeof undefined) => undefined => undefined is a primitive value representing the absence of an assigned value.
// let a = "sameer"
// console.log(typeof(a))
// console.log(typeof a)
